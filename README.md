# Surprise-Housing-Australia
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. .

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Housing proce and features of house data is collected.
- Model the price of houses with the available independent variables.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The optimal value of Lambda for Ridge regression is 1.
- The optimal value of Lambda for Lasso regression is 0.0001,
- Key features to predict housing price are '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'BsmtQual', 'BsmtUnfSF', 'ExterQual'.
- MSE for Ridge regression = 0.00314 by using 50 features.
- MSE for Lasso regression = 0.00315 by using 34 features.
